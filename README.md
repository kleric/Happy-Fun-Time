Shamir's Secret Share Problem Solver. The name is entirely irrelevant. Fetches the keys from the Spreadsheet with all the keys, then attempts to solve from those keys.

The Spreadsheet of keys can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/a/kleric.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnN-5p9SwIfUdHl4Rl9lRGg5VjRoR1pISVdMLWk5TGc#gid=0).

Rahul has also implemented a "Playground" which allows a multitude of actions.
 - solve (solves, but requires 50+ keys)
 - fsolve (forces a solution without 50+ keys, usually results in garbage)
 - encode (encodes a string into the numbers)
 - decode (decodes numbers into a string)
 - join (joins together with keys)
 - split (splits into keys)
 - prime
